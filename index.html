    <h1>Rainer Maria Rilke â€“ from The Book of Hours (I, 2)

I live my life in widening circles
that reach out across the world.
I may not complete this last one,
but I give myself to it.

I circle around God, around the primordial tower.
I've been circling for thousands of years
and I still don't know: am I a falcon,
a storm, or a great song?!</h1>
